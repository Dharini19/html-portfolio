    <h1>About Information Technology</h1>
    <p>So much of today's world is powered by technology. In fact, Spratling said it's hard to find any area of modern life that doesn't already have some usage or application of information technology.

        "To add to that, anything can be enhanced or improved or made more efficient through the implementation of technology," he said. "In a nutshell, that sort of says why it's important."
        
        As technology continues to grow and evolve throughout many facets of daily life, the ways we interact with technology are changing, too. "Technology moves so fast, so it's definitely important that we pay attention," said Spratling.
        
        He noted laws are always behind technology, so staying current with the technical side is imperative to keeping up with legal and social changes that come with it. In that way, being technologically literate can invite you into vital conversations and allow you to participate in finding solutions.
        
        "Let's see what problems we can solve," Spratling said.</p>
